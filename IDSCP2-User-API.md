This documentation describes the user API for the IDSCP2 protocol.
All the files and directories are relative to *idscp2/src/main/kotlin/de/fhg/aisec/ids/idscp2/*.

See [User Documentation](UserDocumentation) for a showcase, how to configure and use an IDSCP2 peer.

## Remote Attestation

Remote attestation (RAT) is responsible for proving the remote peer to be in a trusted communication state. The IDSCP2
protocol supports a RAT driver interface that allows using different RAT implementations, e.g. Intel SGX or TPM drivers.

### RAT Driver

RAT driver instances are generated by the FSM on the fly using the RAT registries. Each peer must register the RAT 
prover implementation for proving the local state to the remote peer, as well as the RAT verifier for verifying the
state of the remote peer. Thus, the user has to register the desired drivers to the registries.

Default RAT driver implementations can be found at *default_drivers/rat/*.

### RAT Registry

Register a driver to the prover registry. It takes the instance, an unique cipher suite identifier, the driver factory,
which is actually the prover driver implementation class, and an optional implementation-specific driver configuration, 
that will be passed to the driver instances on on creation.

```kotlin
fun <PC> registerDriver(
                   instance: String, 
                   driverFactory: (RatProverFsmListener) -> RatProverDriver<PC>, 
                   driverConfig: PC?
)

```

The same method is supported by the verifier registry.

```kotlin
fun <VC> registerDriver(
                   instance: String, 
                   driverFactory: (RatVerifierFsmListener) -> RatVerifierDriver<VC>, 
                   driverConfig: VC?
)

```

Unregister a driver from the RAT registry using the unique identifier. This is supported by both, the verifier and the
prover registry.

```kotlin
fun unregisterDriver(instance: String)
```

RAT registries can be found at *idscp_core/rat_registry/*.

### AttestationConfig

The attestation config provides the RAT cipher suites and the RAT timeout interval from the user to the FSM.
A builder pattern can can be used for setting the local RAT prover suite (supported suite), the local RAT verifier
suite (expected suite) and the RAT timeout delay. 

```kotlin   
fun setSupportedRatSuite(suite: Array<String>): Builder
    
fun setExpectedRatSuite(suite: Array<String>): Builder

fun setRatTimeoutDelay(delay: Long): Builder

fun build(): AttestationConfig
```

Check if two attestation configs are equal:
```kotlin
fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean
```

Build the hash of the attestation config:
```kotlin
fun hashCode(): Int
```

The AttestationConfig can be found at *idscp_core/api/configuration/*.

## DAPS Driver

The Daps driver is responsible for providing authorization tokens of the local peer to the FSM and for verifying the 
remote authorization tokens during the handshake. This is done by the FSM. The user just has to select a DAPS 
implementation, create it and pass it to the Idscp2Configuration.

Default DAPS driver implementations can be found at *default_drivers/daps/*.

---

## SecureChannelDriver

The SecureChannelDriver interface is implemented by the SecureChannelDriver implementations and is responsible
for starting the SecureServer (e.g. TLSv1.3 server) or for connecting to IDSCP2 peers.
First one is not directly used by the user, instead the SecureChannelDriver is passed to the Idscp2ServerFactory
that will create the Idscp2Server and wrap the SecureServer component, such that the user does only have to deal with
the IDSCP2 layer.

In contrast, for connecting the user has to directly use the SecureChannelDriver. It returns a completable connection 
future that must be handled via asynchronous future handlers. See [User Documentation](wiki/UserDocumentation) for
an example.

```kotlin
interface SecureChannelDriver<CC : Idscp2Connection, SecureChannelConfiguration> {
    fun connect(
        connectionFactory: (SecureChannel, Idscp2Configuration) -> CC,
        configuration: Idscp2Configuration,
        secureChannelConfig: SecureChannelConfiguration
    ): CompletableFuture<CC>

    fun listen(
        channelInitListener: SecureChannelInitListener<CC>,
        serverListenerPromise: CompletableFuture<ServerConnectionListener<CC>>,
        secureChannelConfig: SecureChannelConfiguration
    ): SecureServer
}
```
Default SecureChannel driver implementations can be found at *default_drivers/secure_channel/*.

---

## IDSCP2 Configuration

The Idscp2Configuration is responsible for passing the daps driver, the attestation configuration, the
handshake timeout interval and the acknowledgment timeout interval to the FSM. A builder pattern is used
for creating it.

```kotlin   
fun setAttestationConfig(config: AttestationConfig): Builder

fun setDapsDriver(dapsDriver: DapsDriver): Builder
   
fun setHandshakeTimeoutDelay(delay: Long): Builder

fun setAckTimeoutDelay(delay: Long): Builder

fun build(): Idscp2Configuration
```

Check if two Idscp2Configurations are equal:
```kotlin
fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean
```

Build the has of the Idscp2Configuration:
```kotlin
fun hashCode(): Int
```

Get the Idscp2Configuration in string format
```kotlin
fun toString(): String
```

The Idscp2Configuration can be found at *idscp_core/api/configuration/*.

---

## IDSCP2 Connection

The Idscp2Connection will be created by the protocol either on connecting to a remote peer or 
on accepting a new peer at the Idscp2Server. It provides the following API to the user:

Register or unregister a connection listener that will be notified on connection closure and on 
connection errors:
```kotlin
fun addConnectionListener(listener: Idscp2ConnectionListener)

fun removeConnectionListener(listener: Idscp2ConnectionListener): Boolean
```

Register or unregister a message listener that will receive incoming IDSCP2 data messages: 
```kotlin
fun addMessageListener(listener: Idscp2MessageListener)

fun removeMessageListener(listener: Idscp2MessageListener): Boolean
```

To avoid race conditions that could occur when the listeners are not registered yet while the
connection already receives some data from the remote peer, the user has to unlock messaging after
listener registration:
```kotlin   
fun unlockMessaging()
```

Close the Idscp2Connection. Throws an exception when the connection has never been started.
```kotlin
@Throws(Idscp2Exception::class)
fun close()
```

Send bytes to the remote IDSCP2 peer without blocking. This returns an Idscp2WouldBlockException when the 
FSM would block this operation due to earlier messages that first have to be transmitted.
An Idscp2Exception is thrown when the connection is closed, an error occurred or the connection is currently not
established due to re-attestations.
```kotlin
@Throws(Idscp2Exception::class, Idscp2WouldBlockException::class, Idscp2NotConnectedException::class)
fun nonBlockingSend(msg: ByteArray)
```

Send bytes to the remote IDSCP2 peer with blocking when the FSM would block.
Throws an Idscp2TimeoutException when the timeout interval in milliseconds is reached. The retry interval specifies
the duration in milliseconds that should be waited until sending the data again.
An Idscp2Exception is thrown when the connection is closed, an error occurred or the connection is currently not
established due to re-attestations.
```kotlin
@Throws(Idscp2Exception::class, Idscp2TimeoutException::class, Idscp2NotConnectedException::class)
fun blockingSend(msg: ByteArray, timeout: Long, retryInterval: Long = 0)
```

Trigger a re-attestation of the remote peer. 
Throws an Idscp2Exception on error or when the connection is closed.
```kotlin
@Throws(Idscp2Exception::class)
fun repeatRat()
```

Check if the connection is in a connected/trusted state.
```kotlin
val isConnected: Boolean
```

Check if the connection is locked forever.
```kotlin
val isClosed: Boolean
```

The Idscp2Connection, as well as the following listeners, can be found at *idscp_core/api/idscp_connection/*.

### Connection Listener

The connection listener interface has to be implemented by an instance that has to be registered to the Idscp2Connection 
for keeping track of the connection state.

```kotlin
interface Idscp2ConnectionListener {
    fun onError(t: Throwable)
    fun onClose()
}
```

### Message Listener

The message listener interface has to be implemented by an instance that has to be registered to the 
Idscp2Connection to receive the IDSCP2 payload (bytes) from the remote peer.

```kotlin
fun interface Idscp2MessageListener {
    fun onMessage(connection: Idscp2Connection, data: ByteArray)
}
```

## IDSCP2 Server

The IDSCP2 server is responsible for accepting new IDSCP2 connection requests from other peers.
It is created using the Idscp2ServerFactory and provides the following methods to the user:

Check if the IDSCP2 server is running:
```kotlin
val isRunning: Boolean
```

Get all IDSCP2 connections that are currently open at this Idscp2Server:
```kotlin
val allConnections: Set<CC>
```

Terminate the Idscp2Server and all its open connections:
```kotlin
fun terminate()
```

The Idscp2Server can be found at *idscp_core/api/idscp_server/*.

### Idscp2ServerFactory

Constructing an Idscp2ServerFactory requires a connection factory, responsible for creating new 
Idscp2Connections during the handshake with the new peer, an Idscp2EndpointListener that will be notified
on new connections and server errors, the Idscp2Configuration, the SecureChannelDriver, which is used for 
starting a secure server on which the Idscp2Server is based on, as well as the implementation-specific 
SecureChannelConfiguration, which might contain address and security information.

```kotlin
connectionFactory: (SecureChannel, Idscp2Configuration) -> CC,
endpointListener: Idscp2EndpointListener<CC>,
configuration: Idscp2Configuration,
secureChannelDriver: SecureChannelDriver<CC, SecureChannelConfiguration>,
secureChannelConfig: SecureChannelConfiguration
```


Using the listen method on the Idscp2ServerFactory, the user can create and start an IDSCP2 server:
```kotlin
@Throws(Idscp2Exception::class)
fun listen(): Idscp2Server<CC: Idscp2Connection>
```

The Idscp2ServerFactory can be found at *idscp_core/api/idscp_server/*.

### Idscp2EndpointListener

The Idscp2EndpointListener is registered at the Idscp2Server via the Idscp2ServerFactory to keep track
of new connections and server errors.

```kotlin
interface Idscp2EndpointListener<T: Idscp2Connection> {
    fun onConnection(connection: T)
    fun onError(t: Throwable)
}
```

The Idscp2EndpointListener can be found at *idscp_core/api/*.
